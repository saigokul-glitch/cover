        features of machine learning in tech field
         Machine learning is a field of computer science that enables systems
         to learn from data and improve with experience.
         It focuses on building models that can recognize patterns, make predictions,
         and support decision-making.
         Instead of being explicitly programmed, ML systems adapt their behavior based on the
         information they receive.
         The main goal of machine learning is to create intelligent solutions 
         that become more accurate over time.
